## On notation of matrixes (aka. **row/column issue**)

I like to think of MATLAB dealing with the row/column issue as saying that columns contain different variables, and rows contain different observations of those variables. Thus, the rows might be different observations in time of three different temperatures, which are represented in columns A, B, and C. This is consistent with MATLAB's behaviour for sum, mean, etc., which produce "the sum of all my observations for each variable".
