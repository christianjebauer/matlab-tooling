% RMPATHS Remove directory from search path recursively
%
%   RMPATHS(DIR1, DIR2, ...) recursively removes the directories DIR1, DIR2 from
%   the search path. Recursively means, if there is a 'finish.m' script or
%   function in the directory, it will be called.
%
%   P = RMPATHS(...) returns the path prior to removing the specified paths.
%
%   Outputs:
%
%   P                   The path prior to removing the specified paths.
